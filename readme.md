Histogram equalization is a technique for adjusting image intensities to enhance contrast. In this post, I implement grayscale image histogram equalization and three methods of color image histogram equalization. Detail analyses and results are given.

The three histogram equalization methods for color image are independent histogram equalization based on color channel, histogram equalization based on average value of color channel and intensity component equalization based on HSI color space.

Images are available. Codes implemented with [The CImg Library](http://cimg.eu/) in C++ language. For more detail about the derivation, implementation, results and analyses, please read [my post](https://hypjudy.github.io/2017/03/19/dip-histogram-equalization/).
